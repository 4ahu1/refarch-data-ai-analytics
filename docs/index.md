# AI & Analytics Reference Architecture

In this reference architecture, we are focusing on defining architecture patterns and best practices to build data and AI intensive applications. We are addressing how to integrate data governance, machine learning practices and the full life cycle of a cloud native solution development under the same reference architecture to present and hollistic point of view on how to do it.


# Data is fundamental

What makes managing data so challenging and complex is that, by itself, data doesn't do anything. Data is inert; it is not self-organizing or even self-understanding. In the DIKW pyramid, data is the base with the least amount of perceived usefulness. Information has higher value than data, knowledge has higher value than information, and wisdom has the highest perceived value of all. Data requires something else—a program, a machine, or even a person—to move up the value chain and become information.

The IBM AI Ladder also begins with data. You get higher business value when you perform business-assisted functions such as analytics, machine learning, or artificial intelligence on top of the data.
