# Data and AI Architecture Principles

1. There exists a spectrum of use ranging from single source of truth to data hyper personalisation.  
1. Different roles need specialised data stores with redundancy and replication between them
1. Different application patterns apply different data specialisations.
1. There is a dependency between AI and Data Management.
1. With an **Intelligent Application** there is
  * a Data concern,
  * an AI model management concern,
  * a Multi cloud deployment concern.
1. As you constrain scalability and network connectivity you also constrain data store, data structure and data access.    
1. The value and way of storing and representing data may change with its age. Value also comes in the recognition of patterns in the time series.

Today, our users may have access to terabytes, petabytes, or even exabytes of data. But if that data is not collected, organized, managed, controlled, enriched, governed, measured, and analyzed, that data is not just useless, it can become a liability.
